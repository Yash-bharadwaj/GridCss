# GridCss

**Concept Grid Project**

This project is a demonstration of a concept grid created using HTML and CSS. The concept grid provides a visually appealing way to showcase various ideas, concepts, or designs in a grid-based layout.

**Usage**
To view and interact with the concept grid, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The grid will automatically adjust its layout based on the available screen space.

**Customization**
To customize the concept grid for your specific needs, you can modify the following files:

**index.html:** This file contains the HTML structure of the concept grid. You can add, remove, or modify the items within the grid to showcase your own concepts.

**style.css:** The CSS file controls the visual appearance of the concept grid. You can customize colors, fonts, sizing, and other visual elements to match your desired design.
